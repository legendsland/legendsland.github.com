You should not spend more time on weibo/facebook/twitter, or any other SNS sites.

The reason you get popular is not how long you're staying on the site. It's how smart you use the SNS 'tools'. This is very similar to offline marketing. You products get popular is not because how much money you spend on tv ads, but it's how unique you products are.

No matter whether you want to connect with your friends more closely or want to market your ideas/products online, do it smartly, not longly.

Don't spend more than thirty minutes on SNS sites everyday. It's not worthing.
