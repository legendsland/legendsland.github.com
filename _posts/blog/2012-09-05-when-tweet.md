For a time I really don't understand why Big-Vs post tweets so early in the morning when most of us are still in sleep. Everyday when I get up and open browser, the tweets by same people are on my screen. The first thing of my new day is to read their messages.

I finally realize this is the perfect time of sharing your ideas to other people. You've just take the best time of the day of people. It is amazingly great when the first thing people do in a day is reading your message!

Two things you should remember: your message/tweets/weibo must be real nice, and don't spend too much time to read, just send. The message should be prepared last night when is also a good time to read other's messages and feedbacks, and you need a second thought before sending it out next day.
