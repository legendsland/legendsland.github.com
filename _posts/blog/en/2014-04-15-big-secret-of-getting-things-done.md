This morning I went to supermarket to buy daily food and then with many Dama waited in line to checkout. I guess they are the first group of people entering the supermarket today since they showed interest in nearly dead fish which are cheaper. They are very good at choosing both cheap and quality food. They go to the supermarket earlier than others and therefore have more fresh and better food to choose from.

I successfully avoid them many times because I choose to go to supermarket at the exact opening time. And I've also planned what to buy, so that I checkout quickly.

I don't want to discuss about Dama because this is what they do. What makes me think is how to compete with such *"professionals"* as an amateur.

## Be eariler (maybe only a little) 

Since you can get up early to shopping, why not choose a more accurate time to avoid encounter with them? Though sometimes it's not about how early, it's about how smart. And you can gain big advantage in supermarket if you can get there five minutes earlier than others, including Dama.

## Be prepared

Good preparation makes you fast. Obviously, I would spend more time on choosing what to buy if I haven't decided before I go to the supermarket. And you will face all the competitors in both same time and same space. Good preparation and clear definition of goal make it more possible to get maximum profit and avoid wasting time and potential chaos.

Everyone should go to supermarket, and learn by shopping with or against Dama.
