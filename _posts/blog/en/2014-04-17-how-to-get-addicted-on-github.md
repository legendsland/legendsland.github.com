title: How to Get Addicted on Github

I've spent (wasted) tons of time on all kinds of SNS website, such as Weibo (Chinese version Twitter), Zhihu (Chinese version Quora), and I know I'm kind of addicted to the meaningless and pointless.

The addiction comes from vanity of likes or the number of followers as well as some (flattering) comments. But the valuable followers must come from true fans, and you don't get true fans if you don't create really good staff like useful Apps or thoughtful and readable writings. If you stay on these sites all day, you can create nothing.

These are great platforms for marketing yourself and sharing your views and knowledge to the world though, it's definitely not place for creating, contributing, or actually getting things done, or pushing the projects forward.

Then I decide to quit, and login just to search the information I need.

But there indeed has a place online for creation and creating with other creators. It's Github. The only problem is how can you get as addicted as on those sns sites since code is not as cute as puppies, and coding is not as happy as being followed.

I think github should find a way to make developers addicted on the site like addicted on facebook (or any other SNS in your country). Some thoughts:

1. Top bugs
2. Top cool projects
3. Support code semantic search (which I value most)


(how should I end the post...)
