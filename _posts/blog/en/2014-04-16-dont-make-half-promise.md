I promised never to eat any takeout from local restaurant, specially those small and dirty. Takeout food from those restaurants are not only junk food lack of nutrients but worse. They are not safe, maybe contain some harmful or chemical materials that would hurt you body. The best food to eat is cooked from yourself before you have a better choice, like moving into far more better city or country.



Economically, cooking by yourself is cheaper, but it needs more time and energy. And the hardest thing is you have to overcome your laziness to do it everyday.



After period of trying, I find I always mess up the kitchen because I didn't take cleaning the kitchen in the task list of cooking. I just hate clean the shit after finishing eating. So you can image what the kitchen looks like.



Cleaning kitchen is the invisible cost of cooking. You only make a half promise to cook yourself if you don't clean the kitchen.


A friend once told me that when you decided to do a business, you have to consider both the extra cost like transport and the profit of commodity itself. So is cook. When you've promised to cook everyday,  cleaning kitchen is your extra cost. Promising cooking yourself means you make a promise to clean kitchen.



It's never easy to make a promise. Because most of time you have to do is not only the promised thing itself but more. Only the promise after thoughtful thinking is valuable. Don't make half promise, neither trust it.
