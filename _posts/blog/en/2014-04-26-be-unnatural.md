Ancient Chinese loved nature and natural philosophy more. They thought human beings and the society should follow the rules of nature to behave and act. This truth had kept thousands of years, at least by Chinese philosophers, artists and writers though, modern China has abandoned this philosophy and value completely, and turned to the rules based on money and power.

Ancient Chinese people were lovely nevertheless, and the spirit of truly loving nature was precious. Though using it as dominant law for almost everything including human itself is totally undesirable.

I have the thought above while practicing the violin.

From a natural perspective, human's fingers are not suitable for playing violin because finger patterns and movements includes vertical, right-left, and back-forward three different moves in three dimensional space are not natural.

If you follow the so-called "natural way", you can't play violin at all. But as we know, the most beautiful music played by violin needs unnatural movements of fingers. "Way by Nature" is completely wrong in such situation.

And further, If we human, want to improve and develop, we must break the external and internal constrains from nature. External constrains are easily understood while the internals, like born-with pursuit of comfort or escape from fear are more essential to overcome. The animal instincts are the most natural thing, but the instincts will limit the growth (both biological and psychological) and achievements that intelligent creatures like us could ever have.

What we should seek is the attitude of learning from nature, trying to understand the rules in it, using it or conquering it, not just living in and following blindly.
