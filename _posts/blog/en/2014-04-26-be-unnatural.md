Ancient Chinese loved nature and philosophies based on it more. They thought human beings and the society should behave by following the laws of nature. The chinese word nature "Ziran" means everything should be balanced and in harmony with both physical and social environment. This principle had been practised for thousands of years, by philosophers, writers and even police officers. However industrialising China has abandoned this philosophy and value, to pursuit material richness instead.

Ancient Chinese were lovely nevertheless, and the spirit of truly loving nature was precious. Though using it as dominant rule for almost everything, even for living a life, is totally undesirable.

I have the thought above while practicing the violin.

From a nature philosophy perspective, human's fingers are not suitable for playing violin because when playing, your fingers need to move vertically to press or release strings, or move from right to left, or back-forward, these moves of course, are not natural.

If you follow the so-called "natural way", you can't play violin at all. But as I know, the most beautiful music played by violinists needs unnatural movements of fingers. "Way by Nature" is completely wrong in such situation.

If humans want to improve, develop or evolve, they must break the external and internal constrains from nature. External constrains are easily recognised, however the internals, like born-with enjoying comfort or escaping from fear, are worth to overcome more. The animal instincts are the most natural thing, but the instincts will limit the growth (both biological and psychological) and achievements that intelligent creatures like human could ever make.

We should learn from nature, try to understand the rules in it, use it or break it, not just live and follow blindly and naturally.
