How do you market your products? You can list all the cool features, emotional interface design, beautiful colors, maybe customed fittings. Yes, they are the spec of product, but not the soul. They are what customs would buy, but not why they want to buy it. Good product should tell the custom why he/she should buy it.

I read a post writing about photography. It's really a nice story including a beautiful photo, a  piece of poetry and some techical skills. At the last paragraphy, it says the author designed a social community for guys loving photography. How do you feel about the community created by the author without any detailed information and functionalities. All your fellings comes from the previous images/words shown by the author. If you like the article you will like the product.

That's the real beauty of a community product - full of touching stories and shared by the users.
