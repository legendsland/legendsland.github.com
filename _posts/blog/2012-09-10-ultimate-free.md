Last night I watched a English movie without Chinese subtitle (English subtitle only). I never do this because I thought watching movie should be enjoyment not learning English! But I love that movie so much and cannot find Chinese subtitle anywhere, so I had to turn the English subtitle on. And it was actually not so bad.

We are so familiar with the first or mother language that keeps ourselves in that language as hard as we can. That's the problem. As a programmer, I have my mother language and favorite languages, and I used to think all my career should depend on that. Just so like the guy must use Chinese subtitle but misses the whole point - the movie.

Programming itself is not a career, not even a living-making thing. It's always a means not an end. The end is your product/market/business/profit, and most important your life. You have to expel yourself from that comfortable language garden to think the only one important question "what do you do for a living without that language(s) skill?".

It's the ultimate free. Free yourself to anything.

Stop hitting the keyboard, get your ass up, leave the screen away, and see what else you can do. That is real you, not the guy just talking to machines.
