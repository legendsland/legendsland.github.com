What is the first thought in your mind when alarm clock rings at six o'clock in the morning? "If I get up now I will feel so tired and cannot be efficient at work, so I just need ten minutes more."  This is my thought. My brain tells me I need ten more minutes and I totally agree. About one hour later I wake up with guilty to start a new day, another guilty day.


I really hate houseworking. My brain tells me doing houseworking is totally wasting of time. But most of time I really have to clean some shit out of my house. I cannot pretend that I am loving it no matter how long I've tried and how hard I've *thought*.

These're the same problem that you try to let your brain control your body, especially when the brain is not fully awake. Brain is a good place for excuses and *better ideas*, but is really a bad place for action.

Don't think, just do. And it's the only way leaving guilty and shit out.
