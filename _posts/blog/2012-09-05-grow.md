The most beautiful thing about computation theory is that anything computable can be expressed in recursive functions. Recusion means recursion means recursion... (jokingly). Recursive process repeats its self. Take a naive example, if you want to write a book of ten chapters, which means -- in recursive way -- you will have to write one chapter and then write a (new) book with nine chapters; or you will have to write another (new) book of nine chapters and then write the last chapter. In general we call the first case "iterative" and the second "recusive". They looks similar but different indeed.

We have to accomplish a book in a iterative way. You cannot image a book of nine chapter finished and write the last. This is not how we get things done. In fact you are not write a book, you are grow a book. Grow means the new part is based on all the old parts. The reader will not understand your second chapter if he doesn't read the first.

I believe any process could be viewed and proceeded in a iterative way. The most important thing before you get started is to understand the process iteratively.
