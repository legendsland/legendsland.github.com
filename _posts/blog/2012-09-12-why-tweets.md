title: Why you tweets/weibo or any other shit?

For two reasons:
1. You want your voice to be heard?
2. You want to hear what others (like your bosses/fans/friends/movie stars, etc) said?

You care about that world's (includes yourself) f\*\*king saying too too much. You are pathetic and wasting of (too much) time.

The only way to make your voice heard is that you have something others (like your bosses/fans/friends/movie stars, etc) need/want/appreciate/love...  Voice is the least possible thing.

Get project started, program ran, music played, video recorded, book published.

Leave there, use a tweet plugin/tool to post if you *really* have something to say.

Really have to?
