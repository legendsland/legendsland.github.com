Networking: it isn't just for TCP packets: Networking just means a) meeting people who at some point can do things for you (or vice versa) and b) making a favorable impression on them. Strive to help people. It is the right thing to do, and people are keenly aware of who have in the past given them or theirs favors. If you ever can't help someone but know someone who can, pass them to the appropriate person with a recommendation.  If you do this right, two people will be happy with you and favorably disposed to helping you out in the future.
