### [Reduci.net][reduci]


After a long period of using [Wordpress](http://www.wordpress.com), I found all my needs about blogging are:

1. version control
2. automatic publish
3. full control of style and content

**Quick** (done) and (full) **Control** are two top persuits of hackers. That's where free comes. **Zealous** is the third beautiful thing in their minds. Sometimes it is neither about cool techlonogies, nor about efficient tools. It is all about starting and improving things you **love**.



### [4Clojure answers][4clj-ans]

I am learning [Clojure][clj] recently which is a relative new programming language of Lisp family. It is a pratical fucntional language hosted on JVM/Javascript created by [Rich Hickey][richhickey] at 2007. [4Clojure][4clj] is a website providing programming execises online. There are lots of programming problems there with different difficulty levels. You can practise online without local Clojure enrivonment.



### Link <small>(unpublic yet)</small>


A human-produced hyper-link system. There are not just http links but rather the threads and the nets of all your ideas and knowledge that can be shared and connected. Sometimes it is better to connect all your thoughts like [this](/map/reducer.html).


### Lean <small>(unpublic yet)</small>

It\'s about personal lean. The idea of lean is super great which has applied in many fields including factories and startups. I think it can be also applied in our daily work and life. I am writing a lean GTD web application that would be taken as the roadmap and hotspots of your life.


### Essay <small>(unpublic yet)</small>

I love both writing and programming, so is there a method/tool/application helping you doing the both same time? We all understand code should be documented. The best code can be read like beautiful essay. Is it possible that best technical (mainly about programming) articles could be executed as code? The best part is the code in that article can be executed and the results will be inserted into it. It\'s the other direction of literate programming and I think it\'s a brillant idea!
