### [Reduci.net][reduci]

The site is just started and has not much contents now. But I have plans to build/grow it well. I read a amazing post [Blogging like a hacker][blog-hacker] written by Jeklly\'s creator. I think the post is neither about cool techlonogies, nor about efficient blogging tools. It is all about starting and improving things you love. I have my own opinions about blogging and writing and I think it\'s the time to bring those ideas out of brain. Jekyll and github is a good start. Btw, I hope you like my English posts.



### [4Clojure answers][4clj-ans]

I am learning [Clojure][clj] recently which is a relative new programming language of Lisp family. It is a pratical fucntional language hosted on JVM/Javascript created by [Rich Hickey][richhickey] at 2007. [4Clojure][4clj] is a website providing programming execises online. There are lots of programming problems there with different difficulty levels. You can practise online without local Clojure enrivonment.



### Link <small>(unpublic yet)</small>


A human-produced hyper-link system. There are not just http links but rather the threads and the nets of all your ideas and knowledge that can be shared and connected. Sometimes it is better to connect all your thoughts like [this](/map/reducer.html).


### Lean <small>(unpublic yet)</small>

It\'s about personal lean. The idea of lean is super great which has applied in many fields including factories and startups. I think it can be also applied in our daily work and life. I am writing a lean GTD web application that would be taken as the roadmap and hotspots of your life.


### Essay <small>(unpublic yet)</small>

I love both writing and programming, so is there a method/tool/application helping you doing the both same time? We all understand code should be documented. The best code can be read like beautiful essay. Is it possible that best technical (mainly about programming) articles could be executed as code? The best part is the code in that article can be executed and the results will be inserted into it. It\'s the other direction of literate programming and I think it\'s a brillant idea!
