# Why another blog?

After a long period of using [Wordpress](http://www.wordpress.com), I found all my needs about blog are:

1. version control
2. automatic publish
3. full control of style and content

Github with Jekyll is a wonderfull platform satisfying the needs above. You should have a try, believe me, programmer.
