### who
I am Reduci, a passinate programmer transforming ideas into real products. I love travelling, writing and all kinds of art. I am now living in Shenzhen, China. 张怡 is my Chinese name and you can find me [@reduci][] at Weibo.

### tech
After a long experiences on Linux/C/C++ I found life is short that I should write less code and enjoy more life. So now Clojure(or Scheme, Lisp-like) is my favorite language. I also doing Python/Ruby/Javascript that used for websites. Programming is only just one way of expressing, writing is the another. The problem is what exactly do you want to express, clearly and usefully.


### reduci.net
I am writing my English blog on this site. Articles are mainly about programming and marketing. Concise, brief and thoughful are my goals. You can find my Chinese blog [here](http://legendsland.wordpress.com).


### meaning of reduci
An Italian word refers a person who has had long experience in a particular field. Forget about it.

Reduci*(redoochi)* is abbr for reducing ideas to code:
<code>(reduce code ideas)</code>.

Idea is much cheaper than you think.

Reduce it.
